"""Integration smoke test: each of the 7 phase subgraphs, built standalone via
its `build(resolve_node)`, compiles and runs one full pass over a fresh
`new_state(...)` without raising.

Recommended by design.md's testing-strategy row for `src/graph/` — real
end-to-end coverage of the parallel fan-out/fan-in wiring (phase2) in
addition to the plain sequential phases, all with `NoOpNode` placeholders
since no real node implementations exist yet.
